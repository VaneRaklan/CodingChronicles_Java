# GeneralPractice

As of graduating HS in Juen 2017, I have not taken an actual coding class. However, I have spent four years on a robotics team programming in Java (learning other languages on the side), but the programming there never explicitely required knowledge of major portions of Java in general.

I wanted to create a reference for myself and others to use to see simplified java examples with explanation of what different syntaxes and functions do. For the longest time I didn't know what 'static' and 'void' meant undtil it either dawned on me or looking it up several times.

I'll try to update this ReadMe with links to different Java References that I'm following
