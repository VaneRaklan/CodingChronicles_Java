/* //Abstract Modifiers Vol. 1
When multiple sub classes access super class constructors but require different code for specific constructors, but not all
we can abstract the super class and the specific methods that we need variation for.

This level of abstractions can be compared to inheritence and interfaces.
They act as an organizational tool; a guaruntee if-you-will. When you abstract a method
in a (abstract) class, any subclasses are required to have the corresponding method

Things to know/remember:
- If at least one method in the class is abstract, then the entire class must be labeled as abstract
- An abstract class cannot be instantiated (made into an object)
- An abstact class can still have static variables and static methods
